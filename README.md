# Overview
This repository follows Net Ninja's Next.js tutorial. It covers basics including:
 - Pages & Routes
 - Linking between pages
 - Redirecting users
 - Images & Metadata
 - Data fetching
 - Dynamic routes

 # The Project
 A simple site with a list of people, clickable items within the list that show more information about each person when clicked, and an about page. The actual project itself is more for applying theory and gaining an understanding of Next.js as opposed to serving any meaningful purpose.
